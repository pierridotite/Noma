## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Jupyter notebook extension with `%%noma` cell magic for executing NOMA code in notebooks
- Automatic compilation caching based on SHA256 hash
- Execution logging and artifact management for notebook workflows
- Three example notebooks: getting started, neural networks, and advanced patterns
- String literal support for `print()` function in Jupyter notebooks
- Type casting syntax with `as` operator (e.g., `x as f64`)
- Example file demonstrating Jupyter features (30_jupyter_features.noma)
- Enhanced VS Code extension (v0.1.0) with comprehensive syntax highlighting and 30+ snippets

### Changed
- Revised README with Table of Contents, News section, and improved clarity
- Updated citation format in documentation
- Streamlined CONTRIBUTING.md
- Improved error messages when code is at top-level (suggests wrapping in `fn main() { ... }`)
- Enhanced Jupyter magic to handle empty cells and comment-only cells gracefully

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where empty cells in Jupyter notebooks caused errors
- Fixed type casting syntax parsing and code generation
- Improved error guidance for top-level statement rejection

### Removed
- Removed QUICKSTART.md and related links
- Removed architecture comparison documentation and SVG diagrams

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

#### Core Language Features
- **Control flow statements** — `if-else` conditionals and `while` loops
- **User-defined functions** with inlining support in the computational graph
- **Dynamic memory management** — `alloc`, `free`, and `realloc` for heap tensors
- **Core math functions** — `exp`, `log`, `sqrt`, `pow`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `abs`, `min`, `max`

#### Optimizers & Training
- **Adam optimizer** with momentum and adaptive learning rates
- **RMSprop optimizer** for gradient-based optimization
