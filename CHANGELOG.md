## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

#### Core Language Features
- **Control flow statements** — `if-else` conditionals and `while` loops
- **User-defined functions** with inlining support in the computational graph
- **Dynamic memory management** — `alloc`, `free`, and `realloc` for heap tensors
- **Core math functions** — `exp`, `log`, `sqrt`, `pow`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `abs`, `min`, `max`

#### Optimizers & Training
- **Adam optimizer** with momentum and adaptive learning rates
- **RMSprop optimizer** for gradient-based optimization
- **RNG functions** for weight initialization (`rand_uniform`, `rand_normal`)

#### I/O & Serialization
- **CSV file support** — read and write datasets
- **Safetensors support** — save and load model weights

#### Code Generation
- **LLVM backend** for native CPU execution
- **PTX backend** for NVIDIA GPU execution
- **NVPTX host support** with elementwise kernel execution
- **Fast-math optimizations** for both LLVM and PTX backends

#### Tooling & IDE
- **VS Code extension** with syntax highlighting, snippets, and commands

#### Examples & Demos
- Self-growing XOR demo with Python benchmarking and visualization utilities
- 28 example programs covering tensors, neural networks, optimizers, and I/O

### Changed
- Refactored code structure for improved readability and maintainability
- Enhanced dynamic network growth example for clarity

### Fixed
- Formatting issues in README and loss curve visualizations
